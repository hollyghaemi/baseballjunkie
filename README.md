Altuve vs. Trout Speeds

Given the data in the attached files, determine which of Jose Altuve or Mike Trout was the faster baserunner in 2016. The attached files include player tracking information for balls hit into play during 2016 when the player was either the batter or the runner at first or second base.  The definition of faster speed in this baseball context is up to you to determine and justify.  Construct a chart or other visualization to communicate your findings.  Please include in the form of a Jupyter, RMarkdown, or similar notebook your R or Python code used to analyze the data, produce the visualization.
The x, y coordinates of both Altuve and Trout with their respective times gives rise to the following definition of velocity, aka speed, being measured in feet per second:  

Speed = ∆distance/∆time
